# A Day in the Life

I had class at Epicodus today, and it was a _rough day_. I know I need to be patient with myself, but it's **_definitely_** a challenge.


### Hopes
* Tomorrow will be less frustrating
* I will have more patience
* It's okay to fail and get better


### To do tonight
1. Focus on homework
2. Remind yourself it's alright to be bad at things
3. get as much done as possible
4. relax.
